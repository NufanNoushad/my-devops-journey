🚀 Documenting my DevOps learning journey

Hey there! 👋
I'm currently diving deep into DevOps fundamentals during my first-year summer break as a SWE student. Rather than spreading myself thin, I’ve decided to niche down early — and DevOps is the tech path I’m committing to.

Why DevOps?
Because it’s the perfect blend of software engineering, infrastructure, and automation — and I’m all about building smart, scalable systems.

🌱 What I’m Learning So Far:
🐧 Linux – mastering the shell like a pro

🌐 Networking Fundamentals – understanding the plumbing behind the internet

🌲 Git – because version control is life

☁️ AWS – learning how to cloud like a DevOps engineer

🔄 Ongoing Journey
This repo is my living log. I'll be regularly updating it with notes, projects, mini-guides, and things I wish I knew when I started.
If you're also exploring DevOps, feel free to follow along or contribute!

📌 Goals:

Build a strong foundation in DevOps tools and concepts

Work on real-world-style mini projects

Prepare for internships and certifications down the line

Let’s see where this journey takes me! 🛠️🔥
