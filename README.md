# my-devops-journey

Currently diving into DevOps fundamentals during my 1st year summer break! I believe in picking a tech niche as a CS / SWE student and I have gone ahead and picked DevOps as the field that I want to pursue.

Focused/ing on so far:
Linux
Networking fundamentals
Git
AWS

I will be updating this repository as I learn more and more about DevOps.
