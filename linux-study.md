# Linux Basics & My Learning Journey

## How I Started Learning Linux

I began my Linux journey by following the **FreeCodeCamp Linux for Beginners** YouTube course — a solid 6-hour beginner-friendly tutorial that covers the essentials of the Linux command line, file system, permissions, and more. The course helped me understand the foundational concepts and build confidence using the terminal.

## Getting Hands-On: OverTheWire Bandit

After gaining the basics, I wanted to practice real-world Linux skills, so I started playing the **OverTheWire Bandit** game — a fantastic resource for sharpening command-line and security knowledge.

I played through the levels and successfully reached **Level 12**, tackling challenges that made me comfortable with:

- Navigating the Linux filesystem  
- Understanding file permissions and ownership  
- Using text processing commands like `grep`, `cat`, and `awk`  
- Working with SSH and remote connections  
- Scripting basics and more  

This hands-on practice made the theoretical knowledge from the FreeCodeCamp course stick and gave me practical problem-solving skills.

## Key Takeaways

- Linux command line is powerful and flexible — mastering it opens many doors in DevOps.  
- Practicing through challenges (like OverTheWire) is the best way to learn and remember commands.  
- Don’t rush — take your time exploring commands and reading their manuals (`man <command>`).  
- Consistency is key: even 20 minutes a day helps build muscle memory.

## What’s Next

I plan to deepen my Linux knowledge by applying it during projects and learning as I go.
